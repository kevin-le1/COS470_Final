# Fine-Tuning AI Assistant for Blockchain Problem Solving

## Task Overview
Students will create and evaluate a dataset, then use the top entries to fine-tune an AI assistant. The goal is to explore different ways of enhancing the AI's ability to solve challenging blockchain problems using the curated dataset.

## Objectives
- Explore and experiment with free AI tools and methods to improve performance on blockchain tasks.
- Fine-tune closed-source models.
- Summarize findings and best practices in a final report.

## Deliverables
1. **Final Report**:
   - Summarize the methods used, the rationale for choosing them, and their effectiveness.
   - Provide insights into measurable improvements in the AI assistantâ€™s performance.
   - Predict possible outcomes for unimplemented ideas due to time constraints.
   - Include a summary of best practices for using AI as a learning assistant in this course.

2. **Code and Prompts**:
   - Include final scripts and prompts used during the project.
   - Ensure all files are well-documented and reproducible.

3. **Submission Deadline**:  
   - All deliverables are due on **Dean's Date (Dec 13)**.
   - No extensions allowed per university regulations.

## Grading Criteria
| Component             | Weight | Description                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Final Report**      | 22%    | - Clear and well-structured explanation of methods and rationale.                               |
|                       |        | - Evidence of measurable improvement in AI performance.                                         |
|                       |        | - Addressed weaknesses identified during dataset creation.                                      |


## Notes
- Due to time constraints, implementing all ideas may not be feasible. Sketches and predictions for unimplemented ideas are encouraged in the final report.
- Ensure methods used are free and accessible to all. Paid services are not allowed.
